////Beginning Question
///A single car can accommodate at most 4 people. N friends want to go to a restaurant for a party. Find the minimum number of cars required to accommodate all the friends.

#include <iostream>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here]
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    float N,result;
	    cin>>N;
	    result=N/4;
	    result=ceil(result);
	    cout<<result<<endl;
	    
	}
	return 0;
}




////Intermediate Question
///Given a positive integer N, MoEngage wants you to determine if it is possible to rearrange the digits of N (in decimal representation) and obtain a multiple of 5.
///For each test case, print Yes if it is possible to rearrange the digits of N so that it becomes a multiple 5. Otherwise, print No.
///My approach to solve this question is to find whether digit 0 or 5 is present in the input number or not.If present it is possible to rearrange the digit and make a multiple of 5.
